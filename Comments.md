# Comments

<p>
  We sometimes need to write text that is not code. During this time, we use comments. Many
  times, it is used to explain some code that is hard to understand or to document the code
  for the people who are going to inherit it.
</p>
<p>Comments are text that are ignored by the C compiler.</p>

```C
  // this is a single line comment
  /*
      this is a
      multi-line
      comment
  */
```
