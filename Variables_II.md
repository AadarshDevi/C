# Variables II: Advanced Information

In [Variables I](Variables_I.md) we learned that variables are used to store values. Now
 we are going to go indepth in this topic. In C, there are only 3 types of values.

| Data Type | Data Type Name | Explanation | Value | Example |
| --------- | -------------- | ----------- | ----- | ------- |
| `int` | Integer |Integer numbers, numbers without the <br>decimal point. | `23, 47, 59` | `int age = 18;` |
| `float` | Floating Point Number | Decimal numbers like ùúã,<br> they contain a decimal point. | `12.23, 3.1415, 0.005` | `float height = 165;` |
| `double` | Floating Point Number | Decimal numbers like ùúã,<br> they contain a decimal point. They <br>have more precision than `float`s.<br> The precision is 15 decimal places. | `12.23, 3.1415, 0.005` | `float height = 165;` |
| `char` | Character | They contains either a single letter <br>(UPPERCASE or lowercase), a number<br> or, a symbol.<br> When writing chars, they must <br>be enclosed in single quotes ' '. | `'a', 'B', '5', '#'` | `char grade = 'A';` |

When looking at the table we can see that there are no booleans and strings. It will come later.
