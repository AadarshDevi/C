# Variables I

<p>
  When we create our program, we have values that need to be stored but also change sometimes or constantly.
  These values are stored in containers called variables. so when we have to store a value like age, we can
  store it in a variable.
  - Variables in C work the same way variables in math work.
</p>

<p>There are many times of values and they are listed below:</p>

```
int number = 215;
float num2 = 107.75;
char let = 'A';
char let2 = 'D';
```

Here the values represent different types of variables. These types are called Data Types.<br>
from the examples there is a few information<br>

`int, float, char` are called Data Types and `number, num2, let, let2` are called identifiers, they tell use what the variable is created for.
