# Basic C Program Structure

This is the standard default C program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  return 0;
}
```

This `#include <stdio.h>` is used for printing values to the console and also getting user input.<br>
The `int main()` is the starting point for the C program. When a C program is converted into an executable,
it will first check for this. Without this, the exe file cannot fun.<br>

# Printing to Console

To print anything in C, we use the same line of code: `printf("text")`. below we are printing "Hello World, I am coding in C!".

```c
printf("Hello World, I am coding in C!");
```

# Comments

<p>
  We sometimes need to write text that is not code. During this time, we use comments. Many
  times, it is used to explain some code that is hard to understand or to document the code
  for the people who are going to inherit it.
</p>
<p>Comments are text that are ignored by the C compiler.</p>

```C
  // this is a single line comment
  /*
      this is a
      multi-line
      comment
  */
```
